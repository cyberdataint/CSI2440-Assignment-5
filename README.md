## Overview
This repository contains two C files demonstrating different aspects of programming in C language.

## int_to_float_overflow.c:
This file demonstrates a simple C program that increments an integer variable until a type conversion causes a change in its value.

## min_max_values.c:
This file showcases the minimum and maximum values of different data types in C, including integers, longs, floats, and doubles. It also demonstrates overflow and underflow behavior for unsigned integers.
